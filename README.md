# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

## Description

This repo is used to practice the developement of ML models for NLP and building good habits with MLOps.

## Plan

### Minimalist pipeline

- Make a simple pipeline that executes quickly (fetch data, train, evaluate, produce output).
- Establish a github workflow using CML actions.
- Design a basic software architecture.
- The very first model should be very basic and constitute the baseline. For example: random choice between 0 and 1.

### NLP preprocessing

The data preprocessing will constitute an important part of the development. The following approaches will be successively implemented:

- CountVectorizer from sklearn
- Spacy embedding
- Embedding layer (for NN)

### Model

Classical ML and deep learning models will be investigated:

- logistic regression,
- random forest,
- deep neural networks with TensorFlow using LSTM, GRU, Conv1D ...
